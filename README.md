# Project_Glass_Moon
A Tsukihime-themed tic-tac-toe fangame project
Hello there! This is the start of "Project Glass Moon".
I've named it that because it's more reasonable than Tsuki-tac-toe and Glass Moon OXO.
Before I start, I wanted to say that I'll update this everytime I've think of a feature or an idea. Let's begin shall we?

Aug 15, 2024 - Good morning, yesterday I've added an intro and forgot to update it. I'll be working on the options menu in a bit.

Aug 15, 2024 - I'll be adding volume sliders and the fullscreen functions later. I'm 60% done, but I need to prep for school for now.

Aug 16, 2024 - Finished the Options menu, I didn't expect it was this hard and annoying, but hey, it's finished. Let's move to the main game shall we?

Aug 19, 2024 - Finished the Character-Select Menu. What's last is the main game, and we're done!! For now, let's rest for tomorrow is another challenge.

Aug 25, 2024 - I'm 50%-70% done with the game menu. After that, it'll all be cleanup work from there on.

Aug 25, 2024 - Done with the game!!!
