# Project_Glass_Moon
A Tsukihime-themed tic-tac-toe fangame project
Hello there! This is the start of "Project Glass Moon".
I've named it that because it's more reasonable than Tsuki-tac-toe and Glass Moon OXO.
Before I start, I wanted to say that I'll update this everytime I've think of a feature or an idea. Let's begin shall we?

Aug 15, 2024 - Good morning, yesterday I've added an intro and forgot to update it. I'll be working on the options menu in a bit.
Aug 15, 2024 - I'll be adding volume sliders and the fullscreen functions later. I'm 60% done, but I need to prep for school for now.
