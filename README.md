# Project_Glass_Moon
A Tsukihime-themed tic-tac-toe fangame project
# Hello there! This is the start of "Project Glass Moon".
# I've named it that because it's more reasonable than Tsuki-tac-toe and Glass Moon OXO.
# Before I start, I wanted to say that I'll update this everytime I've think of a feature or an idea. Let's begin shall we?
